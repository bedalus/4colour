# Contribution Guidelines

NOTE: These guidelines apply only to code in the 4colour repo.

## Coding Standards
- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python or equivalent standards for other languages.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write modular, reusable, and succinctly documented code. To avoid clutter, do not document self-explanatary code.
- The preference is for precision, not creativity.

## General Rules
- Always include comments for complex logic.
- Avoid hardcoding values; use configuration files or constants.
- Write unit tests for all new features or changes. Include documentation for running the unit tests in a top level folder called 'tests'

## Project-Specific Rules
- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions.
- Use `PascalCase` for classes.
- Ensure all code passes linting and formatting checks before committing.
- Use lowercase names for folders.
- Even though I am English, use the American spelling of colour, i.e. color, except for the title '4colour'.

## Test-Driven Development

To ensure smooth development and avoid regressions:

- Update unit tests whenever functionality changes - this is as important as the implementation itself.
- Tests should be updated to match the new behavior, not the other way around.
- Run tests before and after making changes to verify that your implementation works correctly.
- If a test fails, understand whether it's because of a bug in the implementation or because the test needs to be updated for new behavior.
- All new features must have corresponding tests in the `tests` directory.
- Consider writing tests before implementing a feature to clarify expected behavior.

Tests can be run with: python -m unittest discover -s tests

## Planning

New work items should be itemized and preceded by an empty checkbox (`- [ ]`). When engaging in a new coding session to implement new features and improvements, follow the requirements in sequential order starting at the first unmarked checkbox. Once the feature and corresponding unit tests are written or updated to the required specification, mark the checkbox as complete ([x]) to track progress. Always remember to complete this step.

If new files are introduced, or if files are removed, update the '## Project Structure' section below accordingly.

**Introducing New Work Phases:**

When the current phase's objectives are complete or a new major area of work is identified, introduce a new phase at the end of this ReadMe file. Follow the following format:

1.  **Add a Phase Heading:** Use a level 3 Markdown heading with the format `### Phase [Number]: [Brief, Descriptive Title]`. Increment the phase number sequentially.
2.  **Write a Summary:** Immediately below the heading, add a short paragraph summarizing the overall goal or focus of this new phase. Explain *why* this work is being undertaken.
3.  **Structure Work Items:** List the specific tasks for the phase using the standard format:
    *   Start each major task with `- [ ] **Task Description:**`. Use bold text for the main task description.
    *   Use nested bullet points (`    *   Sub-task or detail`) for breaking down the main task or adding specific implementation notes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key files and directories:

*   `canvas_app.py`: The main application class that initializes the UI and managers.

*   `README.md`: This file, providing project documentation, guidelines, and planning.

### Phases 1-7 Summary

The initial development phases (1-7) established the core functionality of the canvas application. This included setting up the Tkinter UI, implementing basic circle drawing and random coloring on click, adding data storage for circle properties (ID, coordinates, color, connections), and introducing a mechanism to connect circles. A selection mode was implemented, allowing users to place a circle and then select existing circles to connect to, confirming with the 'y' key. An "adjust" mode was added to allow moving circles via drag-and-drop and removing circles via right-click. Significant refactoring occurred, including centralizing event binding management based on application modes (CREATE, ADJUST, SELECTION), improving mode transitions, enhancing UI feedback (button text, hint text, canvas background color changes), and consolidating circle removal logic.

### Phase 8-9: Summary

Phases 8 and 9 focused on implementing deterministic coloring based on the Four Color Theorem, followed by optimization and refactoring. A color priority system (1=yellow, 2=green, 3=blue, 4=red) was established with utility functions to convert between priorities and color names. The application now assigns colors based on connectionsâ€”when two connected circles have the same color, a conflict resolution algorithm assigns the lowest available priority color to ensure connected circles never share the same color. A placeholder for advanced network color reassignment was added for cases when all lower priorities are used. The codebase was then optimized by removing redundant color fields, since colors are now derived directly from priorities. Utility functions were extracted to a separate module to improve reusability and testability. Comprehensive unit tests were added for all the new functionality, ensuring the coloring logic works correctly across various scenarios.

### Phase 10-11: Summary

Phase 10 enhanced connections with curved lines using Tkinter's smoothing, adding draggable midpoints to adjust curve shapes. Displacement vectors store curve offsets, maintained when circles move. Unit tests verified curve behavior in various scenarios.

Phase 11 expanded integration tests (`test_integration.py`) to cover complex component interactions. Tests were added for dragging circles and midpoints, ensuring coordinate and connection updates. Removal cascade tests were enhanced to verify neighbor updates and color conflict checks. New tests validated color conflict resolution during connections, the complete reset functionality of clearing the canvas, and the side effects of mode transitions (e.g., midpoint handle visibility, hint text display, background color changes).

### Phase 13: Track the Clockwise Sequence of Connections to Circles

Phase 13 established a method to determine the clockwise order of connections around each circle, storing this in ordered_connections (connection_manager.py).

Phase 14 aims to implement a more complex algorithm for reassigning colors across the network when simple local adjustments are insufficient. This often involves graph traversal and potentially techniques related to proving or applying the Four Color Theorem. The ordered connection information from Phase 13 could be useful for Phase 14 because:

1.  Planar Graph Algorithms: Many algorithms designed for planar graphs rely on knowing the cyclic order of edges around each vertex. This information defines the planar embedding and is crucial for operations like identifying faces or traversing the dual graph.
2.  Kempe Chain Heuristics: Algorithms attempting to prove or apply the Four Color Theorem often use Kempe chains (paths alternating between two colors). Identifying and manipulating these chains might require knowing the local arrangement of connections around a circle, which the clockwise order provides.
3.  Systematic Traversal: When the reassignment algorithm needs to explore the network (e.g., using backtracking or recursion as mentioned in the Phase 14 plan), having a consistent, topologically meaningful order for visiting neighbors (the clockwise order) can simplify the logic compared to an arbitrary order.

### Phase 14: Track which circles are at the border

This phase aims to establish tracking of the border of the map. Circles will be classed as 'at the border' if they are not enclosed. The most basic example is a triangle arrangement with one in the middle. The middle one would be classed as 'enclosed'. This will be useful information for phase 15, where the red color (priority 4) must be swapped from the border to an enclosed circle by exchanging priorities. In order to keep track of the border, assessments will be performed whenever new connections are made in CREATE mode, or when any change in ADJUST mode causes an update to a circle's ordered_connections.

Get gemini to plan this out.


### Phase 15: Advanced Color Network Reassignment

This phase focuses on developing a sophisticated algorithm for reassigning colors throughout the network of connected circles when simple conflict resolution is insufficient. Currently, the application assigns priority 4 (red) as a fallback, but a more optimal solution would rearrange existing colors to maintain the Four Color Theorem guarantee.
